          I've been a programmer since I was in middle school- but I didn't realize that until much later.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 8th grade, I became fascinated with the idea of creating my own video game. I had no
          programming experience, but I found a tool online called Game Maker. The program had a drag-and-drop interface
          to help non-programmers get started, but every command had a "Game Maker Language" equivalent. As I transitioned between the two, I began to inadvertently learn some of
          the fundamentals of programming.
        </p>

        <p>
          In high school, I took a Computer Science elective and found that I recognized a lot of the core concepts. I
          enjoyed applying the knowledge I had gained on my own, and I soon fell in love with the problem-solving,
          puzzle-like nature of programming. This realization during my senior year is what made me decide to major in
          Computer Science.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've created this site as a portfolio to showcase my experiences,
          with the hopes that I can continue to grow my list of projects and skills. Coming full circle, I've once
          again taken up game design on the side with the hopes of eventually releasing my own game.
        </p>

        <p>
          So if I'm not stuffing my face with food, coding for money, reading something programming-related, working out, or winning at Mario Kart, that's probably what I'm doing.
