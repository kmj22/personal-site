          <p>Hi- I'm Kevyn. I do full stack software development.</p>

          <p>I'm currently  the lead developer at a cybersecurity startup, SecondWrite!</p>

          <p>
            My greatest strength is server side development (particularly with Java or Python), but I'm also proficient with front-end development via the Angular Framework (as well as the standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript combo). Now I'm
            comfortable working just about anywhere on the development stack.
          </p>

          <p>
            More recently, I've become interested in technologies such as Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes.  I am currently studying for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam, which I hope will help make me a more well-rounded developer.
          </p>

          <p>I'm also an avid gamer and an enthusiast game developer. I go outside sometimes too- I especially enjoy
            hiking in the warmer months.</p>

          <p>
            I love new challenges. Feel free to <a href="mailto:kevynjaremko@gmail.com" target="_blank">get in touch</a>,
            and we can discuss your project needs. Whether it's a new website, a server-side API, or something in
            between, I'm confident that I can help.
          </p>

        <p>Much like with my time at Giftapart, I have taken on a variety of roles since joining SecondWrite as a fully remote Software Engineer.</p>
        <p>My most familiar tasks involved traditional software development in Python- for example, I refactored a file scanning Python Flask API to use a queue-based architecture, resulting in a more than ten-fold increase in capacity to serve simultaneous requests.</p>
        <p>In addition, I've also been exposed to some machine learning concepts, such as feature extraction and using ROC curves to choose a threshold for binary classification.  I am responsible for maintaining and retraining our machine learning models to keep our verdicts as accurate as possible.</p>
        <p>Perhaps my greatest challenge thus far has been the DevOps part of the job.  In my day to day work, I manage our cloud-based servers and keep our infrastructure running.  I have become familiar with tools such as Jenkins and Ansible, and I have even learned to use many AWS services such as CloudFormation and EC2 as well.</p>
        <p>
          There’s no shortage of things that can go wrong, which means every day has a new challenge to overcome. I’d be
          lying if I said it was easy, but I’m learning a ton.

            <a href="https://kevynthejar.itch.io/even-heroes-die" target="_blank">Even Heroes Die</a> is a 2D platforming game about a hero who is slowly dying. The hero will come across various
            cures to extend his life, but each comes with its own adverse side effects. Players must balance these
            stacking side effects and budget their time between preparation and exploration in order to survive.

          <p>You can play the demo and learn more about the project <a href="https://kevynthejar.itch.io/even-heroes-die" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <p>This is my own independent project I've been working on in my spare time. I'm developing it with Game Maker
            Studio.</p>
