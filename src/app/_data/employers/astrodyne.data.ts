  description: [
    'Astrodyne TDI is a power-supply company- I worked for their IT Team to build software to support other Astrodyne employees.',
    'For example, I built an inventory management system that acted as an interface between other employees and the company database. I also rebuilt a lot of the company\'s legacy software from the ground up, bringing the applications into the "modern age" by recreating them in C#. ',
    'This internship gave me the important responsibility of developing software to be used by others to perform real business tasks- one of my first times doing so in my career. It taught me to interface with clients, gather information about their needs for the project, and work with them when something doesn\'t go as expected.',
