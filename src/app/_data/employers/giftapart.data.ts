    'If there’s one constant in software development (or life), it’s change.  Nothing has proven this sentiment to me more than my time at Giftapart.',
    'Giftapart is an ecommerce startup that hopes to transform the way we gift.  I was part of the team from the first line of code, originally hired as a backend Java/Spring developer.  Over the years, I took on many different roles and challenges.',
    'Once the core of our application was coming along, I took the lead in developing our web frontend.  Most of what I know about CSS and JavaScript was learned on the job, not to mention the Angular Framework. ',
    'Each time I’d gotten comfortable with the UI we’d built, there would be a redesign.  And each time we finished and looked back, we knew we’d improved.  The revisions never stopped, but they were always for the better.',
    'By the end of my full-time position at Giftapart, I was leading development of the frontend website and backend APIs.  I was also in charge of ensuring our users could search across millions of products from hundreds of different retailers, as well as keeping our servers up and running.',
    'Although my full-time role at Giftapart has ended, I continue to contribute to the project as an independent contractor, helping fix bugs and keeping the site up and running.'
