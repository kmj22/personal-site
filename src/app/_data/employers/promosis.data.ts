    'Promosis was my first foray into finding remote work as an independent contractor.  The company exists to create sweepstakes, skill contests, loyalty programs, and instant-win games to help their clients connect with customers.',
    'Whereas my work with Giftapart was mostly built from the ground up, my time at Promosis saw me contributing to many established projects for existing clients.  These projects were primarily created with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.',
    'My largest project for Promosis was to create a donation webpage for a SimpliSafe campaign.  This was a great opportunity for me to become accustomed with Stripe\'s payment platform.',
    'I also collaborated in the development of PryzeMe, an upcoming website/app to host and enter sweepstakes.',
